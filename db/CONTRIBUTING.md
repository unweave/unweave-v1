## Contributing 

Queries should be organized in separate `.sql` files by table name inside the `queries`
directory. For example, all queries related to the `exec` table should be in `exec.sql`.

Inside each file, queries should be sorted alphabetically and be prefixed with the table 
name. For example, the query to get all `exec` records should be named `ExecGetAll`.
